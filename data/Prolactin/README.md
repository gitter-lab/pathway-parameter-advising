# Prolactin

This directory holds pathway and graphlet files from reconstructing the [NetPath Prolactin pathway](http://netpath.org/pathways?path_id=NetPath_56 "NetPath Prolactin Pathway") from a 30% sample.

Pathways were generated using [NetBox](http://sanderlab.org/tools/netbox.html "NetBox Homepage") over a parameter sweep of the `p` parameter and are provided in .sif format.
