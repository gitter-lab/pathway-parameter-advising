# IL2

This directory holds pathway and graphlet files from reconstructing the [NetPath IL2 pathway](netpath.org/pathways?path_id=NetPath_14 "NetPath IL2 Pathway") from a 30% sample.

Pathways were generated using [NetBox](http://sanderlab.org/tools/netbox.html "NetBox Homepage") over a parameter sweep of the `p` parameter and are provided in .sif format. 

Graphlet files are the output from the [Parallel Graphlet Decomposition library](http://nesreenahmed.com/graphlets/). Files are the piped output from the pgd script.
